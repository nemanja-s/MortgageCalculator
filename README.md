# Mortgage Calculator

If you're considering buying a house or another type of property, you'll likely have to shop around for a mortgage loan. This type of loan is specific to property purchases and usually carries a low interest rate compared to other loans. This is because the loan is secured using the property, meaning that the lender, in many cases a bank, has the right to seize the property in the event that the borrower fails to pay them back.[1] As such, it's important to find the loan with the cheapest rate you can so that you can pay it back responsibly and in a reasonable amount of time. Use the following methods to calculate your monthly payments so that you can make the right choice.
